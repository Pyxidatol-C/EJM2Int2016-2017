# Roman Empire
## Introduction
### Brainstorm
- Republic **(509 - 44 BC)**
- Empire **(27 BC - 1453 AD)**
	- ~ - **476 AD** Western Roman Empire
	- ~ - **1453 AD** Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire 
- Adrians wall -> England
- Emperors
	- *Julius Caesar* **100 BC - 44 BC**
	- **49 BC** Caesar declared himself as emperor, took over power from republic
	- *Augustus*
- Expansionism
- Industrially developed
- speaks Latin but not solely
- mythology
- Religion / gods
- Gladiator -> violence, *war*

### Republic
- Senat
- a man's reputation mainly based on two things:
	- law
	- army
- Cicero (**106 BC - 43 BC**)
	- politician, philosopher

### Documentary
[Roman Empire-Ancient Superpower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dvLuwoWFKM)
Themes covered:

- war - violence - pride - more organized warfare
- economy / culture
- slavery
- organization - taxes
- effect on provinces - Romanization - language => Latin
- infrastructure / roads / sewage system - town (instead of tribes)
- Christianity 
- legal codes - civil servants

=> The Romans developed **public administration**.   

The western world derives its intellectual and cultural aspects from the Greeks, but its methods of living, ruling and governing from the Romans.  

=> law and order

### Essay
Why was the Roman Empire able to dominate for so long?

- military (+ infrastructure?)
- Romanization
- administration - government system

## Ch. 1 Process of conquest
### Army
- 130 000 people in army - huge  
- over 60 % males are in the army.  
- rigorous discipline, quality weapon, intense training, strategic dispatching  
- Philosophy / slogan: _I came, I saw, I conquered._  => brutality

#### _Ex: Boudiccan revolution - 60AD_
- husband: Prasutagues, king of Iceni, tribe in U.K.
- after his husband's death, procurator confiscates all the land and money.
- Boudiccan mobilized her tribesmen to revolt against the procurator and emperor.
- reconquered Britain for a short period, until emperor and Welsh army comes back.  
=> strength, power, strategy of Roman Empire => few revolts

### Imperial mission
- rarely recognize themselves as aggressors
- _The only reason for waving wars is for we romans to live in peace._ - Cicero

## Ch. 2 Imperial power
parade of power: parade statue of the emperor -> godlike existence  
problem: in Rome, real emperor **AND** emperor as a godlike figure.
## Ch. 3 Collusion
### Ruling the Roman empire
governors = _reactive_ ≠ _proactive_  
=> non-interventionist: "_They did not interfere in the internal affairs of cities in their provinces._" (p.43)  
=> exception: *Pliny the Younger* - 61 contacts with emperor Trajan over 2 years, most on local affairs.

**Structure:**

- Governor
- elites
- bureaucrats
- Assembly --> town council (200 to 300) --> elected town officials --> Chief Magistrate
	- qualified by wealth

**taxes for**

- running of city
- Rome

=> Win-win situation for Rome, local elites, and common citizens (sewage system, baths, baths, festivals and entertainment, etc.).  
=> *common wealth of independent cities* (p. 47)  

=> sewage systems, lavish baths: race of loyalty to Rome, wanting to become more Roman than Rome  
=> **`Romanization`**: build Roman architectures, dress like Romans, live a Roman life (baths).  
=> **`Romanization`**: seemingly voluntary **"civilization"**, in reality **"enslavement"** (Tacitus, p.57)

## Ch. 4 History wars
**Golden age**  
emperor Hadrian 

- **library** in Athens
- Olympieion - **temple**
- Panhellenion ('All-Greek') - **infrastructure** / council of "Greek" provinces (all have something Greek) / mini-empire inside an empire

=> embrace the Greek heritages  
=> cultural + intellectual aspects & Greek culture

`Turning point`: Rome is no longer focused on military aspects, but more on the intellectual and cultural aspects (living a better life).  
=> **seeds of decline** of Roman Empire

## Ch.5 Christians to the lions

#### Religion  
`polytheist`  
Gods in other religions romanized are automatically taken in to the religion of the Roman Empire.  
=> great tolerance of all signs of spirituality and religion  
=> a more practical approach than spiritual approach  
Different gods is responsible for different things (sea, wine, etc.)  

#### **`Christianity`** = *monotheist* ≠ *polytheist*  

- *only one god, and that god is our god*  
- questions the Roman spirituality  
- trying to convert the Romans to christianity

=> brutally rejected: tortured and executed  

relied on books (Bible, scriptures) to spread the religion

- Romans didn't realize the strength of scriptures

`Great persecution`

- emperor Diocletian
- 23 Feb, 303 AD
- executed Christians, burned books
- effective *(p. 93)*, yet **too late**
- at the end, *the Church was a strong, tightly knit body* 

**Constantine** led to the `christianization` of the empire.  

- first to accept, embrace and embrace the Christian religion
- dream - Chi-Rho (χPIεTOε) - looks like a cross => Milvian Bridge - unexpected crashing victory over Maxentius
- thinks he owes to christianity
- a way to unite the empire
	- He becomes the legitimate human representative / messenger of the one and supreme god  
	=> power

**Nicene Creed**

- June 353 AD
- town of Nicaea
- *"first [...] ecumenical conference of bishops"* (p. 93)
- official foundation of christianity

#### **The games**  
=> violence, strength manifested in a positive way  

## Ch. 6 Living and dying
### House of Menander
- *"one of the smartest residences in Pompeii"* (p. 95)
- built to impress ≠ actual improvement of living standards
- superficial at the lens of today
- represents a small minority
	- *"In a Mediterranean-wide population of some 60 million, the wealthy perhaps numbered no more than 200,000."* (p. 110)

The Roman Empire relies on the `silent majority`. 
### Life expectancy
*Model Life Table, West level 3, Female* (p. 105)

- high infant mortality
	- women reproduced a lot, yet health conditions were poor
- low average life expectancy + few people with old age
	- Cities are densely packed => facilitates the spread of diseases
	- poor sanitation => cholera
- poor condition for the `silent majority`.
- **food**:
	- cattle, meat are rare
	- many trades, however
		- goes to the wealthy, not the silent majority
		- food shortages are very frequent (climatic issues / problems with crops)

### Women
- seldom addressed (yet ≠ totally ignored)
	- stay at home, make babies, cook, knit, wash
	- not citizens
	- not educated
	- dedicated to make more Romans
- very limited information <= not educated
- very much defined by men (father, husband)
- before law, women ≠ men => limited legal rights
	- before 1st century AD, *"in manu"*:  
	the authority transferred from father to husband
	- 1st century AD, *"sine manu*:  
	the authority not transferred from father to husband, but kept in the hand of the father
	- Emperor Augustus, *"soi iuris"*:  
		- women with ≥ 3 children gains authority (independence + legal rights)
		- slave women with ≥ 4 children gains independence + legal right
		- free women still have more rights than slave women
			- female women were mates, worked on farms, some were even gladiators
	- widow - independent
	- authority ≠ no role in public life
		- except for wealthy ones which indirectly influenced the society through men (husband)
			- ex. generals
- still, some (very few) women exercised professions
